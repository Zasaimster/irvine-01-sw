      3. [ ] Run deployment functions/scripts
      4. [ ] Log deployment status
  - [ ] Initial DSA Deployment Integration
* Power On [0/1]
  - [ ] Payload Power On
    - [ ] 5V0_PL_Enable
    - [ ] 3V3_PL_Enable (Is this needed?)
* I2C Expander TCA9554A Kernel Driver [2/3]
  - [X] Add Driver to kernel
  - [X] Driver setup module
  - [ ] Testing
    - [ ] i2cdetect -l 1 shows 0x38 used by kernel
    - [ ] gpio 300-302 come up Low
    - [ ] gpio 296-299, 303 come up High
    - [ ] Can set gpio's 300-303
* DSA Deployment [0/3]
  - [ ] Initial Deployment
  - [ ] Monitor Deployment Sensors
